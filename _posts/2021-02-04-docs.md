## _config.yml
This is the file where configurations affecting the whole site live.


## Posts
* Create posts under `_posts/`
* Posts should include front matter in this format:

`_posts/<YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md>`
```yaml
# Required front matter
layout: post # Posts should use the post layout
title: Content Styles # Post title
date: 2021-02-04 # Publish date in YYYY-MM-DD format
updated: 2021-02-05 # Updated date in YYYY-MM-DD format
author: 
  name: Ritij Jain # Author name
  link: https://ritijjain.com # Author link

# Recommended front matter
tags: # List your tag name along with their Bootsrap contextual style.
- 
  name: tag2 # tag name
  style: secondary # chose from: primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark
- 
  name: tag4
  style: danger
splash_img_source: /assets/img/photo-1556075798-4825dfaaf498.jpeg # Splash image source
splash_img_caption: A sample splash image with a sample caption. Image by Yancy Min on Unsplash. # Splash image caption

# Optional front matter
pin: false # true if this post must be pinned on top of the page, default is false.
listed: true # false if this post must NOT be included on the posts page, sitemap, and any of the tag pages, default is true
index: true # When false, <meta name="robots" content="noindex"> is added to the page, default is true
```

## Projects
* Projects are generated using data stored in `_data/projects.yml`.
* This file contains a list of projects, each of which has key value pairs describing the project:

`_data/projects.yml`
```yaml
- name: Project One # Project name, also used as heading
  id: p1 # Project id, must be unique amongst the projects
  img_src: /assets/img/connectpie-page.png # Optional image
  description_less: > # Description shown at all times
    <p>This part of the project description is visible at all times.</p> 
  description_more: > # Description shown only when the project card is expanded
    <p>This part is only seen when you click on the project card.</p> 
  tags: # List your tag name along with their Bootsrap contextual style
  - 
    name: tag1 # tag name
    style: primary # chose from: primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark
  - 
    name: tag2
    style: secondary
```

## Tags and Tag Pages
* Tags can be added to both posts and projects using this front matter:

```yaml
tags: # List your tag name along with their Bootsrap contextual style.
- 
  name: tag2 # tag name
  style: secondary # chose from: primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark
- 
  name: tag4
  style: danger
```
* Tags always link to their corresponding tag page `/tags/<tag name>`.
* Tag pages must be manually created under `pages/tags`. Each tag page should include front matter in this format:

`pages/tags/<tag name>`
```yaml
title: "Tag: tag1" # This is the page title, could be anything of your choosing.
subtitle: "Posts and projects filtered by tag: tag1." # This is the page subtitle, could be anything of your choosing.
permalink: /tags/tag1 # This is the page permalink, this should be exactly in this format: /tags/<tag name>
tag: tag1 # Tag name should be consistent across tag page, posts and projects.
```

## Redirect Pages
* Redirect pages can bre created under `_pages/redirects`.
* They should include front matter in this format:

`pages/redirects/<name>.md`
```yaml
permalink: /roll/ # redirect origin link
redirect_link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" # redirect destination link
```

## Footer
Change the content on the footer in `_includes/page/about.html`.
