```

## Projects
* Projects are generated using data stored in `_data/projects.yml`.
* This file contains a list of projects, each of which has key value pairs describing the project in this format:

`_data/projects.yml`
```yaml
- name: Project One # Project name, also used as heading
  id: p1 # Project id, must be unique amongst the projects
  img_src: /assets/img/connectpie-page.png # Optional image
  description_less: > # Description shown at all times
    <p>This part of the project description is visible at all times.</p> 
  description_more: > # Description shown only when the project card is expanded
    <p>This part is only seen when you click on the project card.</p> 

    <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" class="btn btn-dark mb-1"><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> &nbsp Repository</a>
    <a href="/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-dark mb-1"><i class="fas fa-align-right"></i> &nbsp Blog Post</a>

  tags: [tag1, tag2] # A list of tags
```

## Tags and Tag Pages
* Tags can be added to both posts and projects as a list of tag names
* Tags always link to their corresponding tag page `/tags/<tag name>`.
* Tag pages must be manually created under `pages/tags`. Each tag page should include front matter in this format:

`pages/tags/<tag name>`
```yaml
title: "Tag: tag1" # This is the page title, could be anything of your choosing
subtitle: "Posts and projects filtered by tag: tag1." # This is the page subtitle, could be anything of your choosing
permalink: /tags/tag1 # This is the page permalink, this should be exactly in this format: /tags/<tag name>
tag: tag1 # Tag name should be consistent across tag page, posts, and projects
tag_style: rgba( 144, 106, 207, 100%) # Tag background color, recommended to use RGBA value
```

## Redirect Pages
* Redirect pages can bre created under `_pages/redirects`.
* They should include front matter in this format:

`pages/redirects/<name>.md`
```yaml
permalink: /roll/ # redirect origin link
redirect_link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" # redirect destination link
```

## Footer
Change the content on the footer in `_includes/page/about.html`.
